        "Summary": "We transformed the regular hands-on skillet method to a very hands-off oven technique.",
        "Ingredients": "['4 pounds russet potatoes, peeled', '1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more', '2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more', '2 onions, thinly sliced', '1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar', 'Freshly ground black pepper', 'Flaky sea salt']",
        "Instructions": "['Parboil potatoes in a large pot of boiling salted water just until a paring knife slides into the center with some resistance, 15–20 minutes. Drain; transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and chill uncovered until cold, at least 30 minutes.', 'Place racks in highest and lowest positions in oven; preheat to 425°. Line two 8\" cake pans with parchment; brush with 2 Tbsp. oil. Toss onions, vinegar, and 1 Tbsp. kosher salt in a large bowl. Let sit until onions are softened, 5–10 minutes (massage gently to speed up process).', 'Meanwhile, grate parboiled potatoes on a box grater or in a food processor, or cut using a julienne slicer. Place prepared pans on lower rack and heat 5 minutes.', 'Add potatoes to onion mixture and toss to combine; season with kosher salt and pepper. Divide potato mixture between hot pans and press down as firmly as possible to compact (a thin flexible spatula works well). Place on lower rack and bake until potatoes are very brown around the edges, 45–60 minutes. Remove rösti from oven; let cool slightly.', 'Heat broiler. Broil rösti on upper rack until tops are golden brown all over. Cut around sides with a small knife or offset spatula to loosen and invert rösti onto a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully remove parchment paper (if potatoes stick, let cool slightly). Brush top of rösti with more oil, sprinkle with sea salt, and broil until second side is deep golden brown.', 'Do Ahead: Potatoes can be parboiled 1 day ahead; once cold, cover. Rösti can be made 3 hours ahead; store uncovered at room temperature (or keep warm in a 250° oven up to 1 hour). Reheat in a 300° oven for 10 minutes before serving.']",

        "Recipe_Name": "BA’s Best Risotto",
        "Link": "https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-risotto",
        "Summary": "Risotto is like a clingy baby. You can’t put it down, you can’t walk away from it, and you can’t ignore it. Its needs are simple, it just wants all of you. And if you give it all of your patient attention, it will turn into a puddle of love. This simple, pure, unadulterated version stands up on its own, but it also makes an excellent canvas for seasonal ingredients—find out more about those toppings below. This is part of BA’s Best, a collection of our essential recipes.",
        "Ingredients": "['1 Tbsp. kosher salt, plus more', '6 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '½ large white onion, finely chopped (about 1½ cups)', '2 cups carnaroli or Japanese sushi rice', '1 cup dry white wine', '5 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces', '1¾ cups finely grated Parmesan, divided', 'Freshly ground black pepper']",
        "Instructions": "['Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 10 cups water in a medium stockpot. Bring to a very bare simmer over medium heat.', 'Meanwhile, heat oil in a 6-qt. Dutch oven over medium. Cook onion and a pinch of salt, stirring frequently, until onion is translucent and starting to soften, 6–8 minutes. Add ½ cup water and cook, stirring often, until water evaporates and onion is sizzling in oil and completely tender, about 5 minutes. (Adding the water allows the onion to cook gently and thoroughly without taking on any color.) Taste onion; if it’s still firm at all, add another splash of water and continue cooking until meltingly soft.', 'Add rice and stir well to coat with oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until grains of rice are translucent around the edges and they make a glassy clattering sound when they hit the sides and bottom of pot, about 5 minutes. Coating the grains with oil before adding any liquid helps the rice cook evenly so that the outside does not become mushy before the center is tender. Add wine and another pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is completely evaporated, about 2 minutes.', 'Reduce heat to medium, then add hot salted water to rice in ¾-cup increments, stirring constantly and allowing liquid to absorb fully before adding more, until rice is al dente and surrounded by fluid, not-too-thick creamy suspension, 25–30 minutes. It should take 2–3 minutes for each addition to be absorbed; if things are moving faster than this, reduce heat to medium-low. Gradual absorption and constant agitation are key to encouraging the starches to release from the risotto, creating its trademark creamy consistency. You may not need all of the hot water, but err on the side of soup rather than sludge. The finished texture should be more of a liquid than a solid. Start checking the rice after about 15 minutes; the grains should be tender but not mushy, with a slightly firm center that doesn’t leave a chalky or bitty residue between your teeth after tasting. Do not overcook!', 'Remove pot from heat, add butter, and stir until melted. Gradually add 1¼ cups Parmesan, stirring until cheese is melted and liquid surrounding risotto is creamy but very fluid. Stir in more hot salted water if needed to achieve the right consistency. Taste and season with salt.', 'Divide risotto among warm bowls. Top each with a grind of pepper. Serve with remaining ½ cup Parmesan alongside for passing.', 'BA’s Best Risotto Parmigiano is good enough to serve on its own, but it’s also an excellent canvas for a whole host of toppings. Here are a few options we love, for whatever season you’re in.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon Andrews', 'Spring: Buttered Sugar Snap Peas with MintHeat 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a large skillet over medium until foaming, about 1 minute. Add finely chopped white and light green parts of 5 scallions, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until scallions are bright green and aromatic, 1–2 minutes. Add 1 lb. sugar snap peas (trimmed, cut in half lengthwise), season again, and cook, tossing occasionally, until crisp-tender, 2–3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in ½ cup sliced mint leaves. Spoon peas and any pan juices onto BA’s Best Risotto.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon Andrews', 'Summer: Burst Cherry Tomato SauceHeat 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium until butter is foaming. Add 4 crushed garlic cloves, season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until garlic is aromatic and starting to brown, 1–2 minutes. Add 2 pints cherry tomatoes and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, tossing frequently and pressing down on tomatoes with a wooden spoon to encourage skins to split, about 5 minutes. Add ½ tsp. red pepper flakes and toss to combine. Taste and season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed. Spoon tomatoes and pan sauce onto BA’s Best Risotto. Drizzle with oil.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon Andrews', 'Fall: Browned Mushrooms with ThymeHeat ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add 1 lb. mushrooms (such as shiitake, crimini, or maitake, trimmed, caps torn into 2\" pieces) and cook, tossing occasionally, until they begin to soften and release some liquid, 3–4 minutes. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper and cook, tossing occasionally, until deeply browned and tender, 8–10 minutes. Add 5 crushed garlic cloves, 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, and 4–5 sprigs thyme and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic softens and butter is golden brown, about 3 minutes more. Remove from heat and add 2 Tbsp. white wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice. Toss to coat, scraping up any browned bits from surface of pan. Pluck out thyme sprigs. Spoon mushroom mixture onto BA’s Best Risotto.Photo by TED + CHELSEA CAVANAUGH, Food Styling by Simon Andrews', 'Winter: Lemon and ChivesStir finely grated zest of 2 lemons, ½ cup thinly sliced chives, and 5 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl; season with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
